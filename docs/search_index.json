["STEM-path.html", "The Path to STEM Gender Disparity in STEM Analysis of Course Paths Applications and Limitations", " The Path to STEM Keywords STEM, STEM courses, gender disparity Gender Disparity in STEM How is it that about half of all undergraduate science and engineering degrees are awarded to women, but only 18% of undergraduate degrees in computer science are awarded to women1? What causes this huge gender gap in some STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields, but not others? Courses may be one factor in this problem. Intuitively, a student’s courses would impact their choice of major. The study of these “course paths” could show patterns of courses that are more or less likely to lead a student to majoring in a STEM field. These course paths could vary based on a student’s gender and other demographics, some leading to a positive outcome (staying in STEM) or not (leaving STEM). Analysis of Course Paths Universities keep extensive records on students, their courses, their grades, and demographic information. These data could be utilized to track the movement through courses of undergraduate students who intend to study a STEM field (e.g., pre-engineering, pre-bio, etc.). Intended major is a data point often collected by college at the time of application. Focusing on students who intend to study STEM will allow us to hone in on course tracks with the desired outcome being a STEM degree, and whether or not those paths actually lead to this outcome. Initially, this analysis will be preformed for STEM as a whole, then for specific STEM fields, such as Psychology/biosciences/social sciences, Engineering, Computer sciences, Mathematics and statistics, Physics, and Economics. Course paths will be compared across fields to find key similarities and differences, which could provide important insight on why some STEM fields are more gender-balanced than others. Further analysis will be conducted on the course demographics to determine where the gender-disparity begins, such as which classes have a gender disparity and if that disparity increases as the courses advance. Other profiling information that may be relevant would also be examined. Student grades, the number of classes taken together, and particular class pairings will be analyzed for their impact on continuation in STEM. This data will be analyzed across specific groups of interest, such as by gender, age or ethnicity, to see if different groups have varying outcomes across course paths. Applications and Limitations Generally, this information will further define the gender disparity in STEM. On a more applicable level, these analyses can be extened beyond STEM fields, and equipping student advisors with this information would help advisors make better course recommendations to students and even extended beyond STEM fields. This project could even be expanded into a course recommendation engine that students can use on their own. This information can identify “trouble” courses. With further analysis of course features, these trouble courses can be redesigned to promote continuation in STEM. There are limitations to this research. Courses and content, as well as the data points each university collects, vary across universities, so data cannot be easily aggregated and must be examined on the university level. Futhermore, specific course features should be added, such as how group-oriented the work is. Even this can vary greatly within a university, from professor to professor, but additional information from course evaluations or professor reviews could fill this gap. Overall, this research will provide important insights into defining and identifying ways to mitigate the gender disparity in STEM degrees.

["student-tracking.html", "Tracking the Student Lifecycle Surveys on surveys. Tracking the student lifecycle. Better serve our community.", " Tracking the Student Lifecycle Keywords continuing education, customer tracking, student lifecycle tracking, student outcomes Surveys on surveys. I work in professional and continuing education. We lack insight on our student lifecycle as a whole. How can we best serve our students when we see their experience from beginning to end? True, we survey our students at key points throughout their time with us: at application, enrollment, as students through course evaluations, at graduation and as alumni. But we produce individual, static reports for each of these survey for 100+ programs. We have no way to synthesize this data and use it productively for the benefit of our students. We have all of this data, from surveys, our databases, vendors, sources such as Career Bridge and LinkedIn, and our CRM, but we are not using this information to it’s fullest extent. By producing static, PDF reports, we miss key information that would enable us to further improve our programs and student experience. Improving our data management processes enables us to improve our student experience. Tracking the student lifecycle. So, we already have all this data, and we’re collecting more all the time. With some careful adjustments, we should be able to link these surveys with our databases and to our vendor data. Each student has a unique, randomly generated ID associated with them in the databases. I propose we include this when we gather the sample lists for our surveys and embed it in the survey data, like we already do with demographic information. When we pull data from our databases, we can include this identifier, then link database data with survey responses. Vendor data is typically already linked to our databases via email, and we could extend the identifer’s use there as well. By using this randomly generated number, we can exclude identifying information, such as names and emails, when we pull data for our reports. Once we have this data linked, we can begin writing interactive reports using tools such as Tableau or Vocalize. We can incorporate improved analysis on open ended questions - word clouds and sentiment anaylsis. We can finally view trends over time, all in one place, instead of bringing up PDF reports for each year. We can compare programs to their sectors. We can follow one cohort through their entire experience with us: enrollment surveys, course evaluations, exit surveys and alumni surveys, not to mention other data we can collect from our vendor sources. Program managers will have more freedom to explore their data, thus making more informed decision about their programs. We can easily see which programs are struggling, when they started struggling, and from there we can make changes to improve them. Better serve our community. Using the lifecycle data, we can better see how we are serving our students: from application feedback, to program satisfaction, and job outcomes. We would have this data all in one, accessible place. Comparisons over time, across programs in a given sector, and following change in cohort opinions and attitudes from beginning to end would give us new insights that we’ve never had access to before. We will make more informed decisions better rooted in our data, and more easily identify fixable issues to improve the student experience. This is by no means perfect. Not everyone will respond to our surveys, and we will have gaps in our data. There are privacy concerns. Even if we use a randomly generated number, it is still associated with identifying information in at least one database. Currently we manage privacy concerns through only allowing access through certain departments, who remove identifying information before handing it off. We can use a similar process to mitigate these privacy concerns. Our surveys are confidential, but not anonymous, and we already have processes in place for handling privacy there. Despite the risks, improving our data processes give us a more holistic view of our students and their experience, and that information will allow us to better serve our students and community. "]
