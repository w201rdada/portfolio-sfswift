## Surveys on surveys.

I work in professional and continuing education. We survey our students at key points throughout their time with us: at application, at enrollment, course evaluations, at graduation and occassionally as alumni as well. Currently, we produce individual, static reports for each of these survey types for each of our 100+ programs. We have all of this data, from surveys, our databases and our CRM, but we are not using it to it's fullest extent.
